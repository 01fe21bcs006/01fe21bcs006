          <p></p><h2>Taj Mahal is one of the main reasons why India is famous. Many people even associate India with Taj Mahal. However, to me, more than the splendid architecture, it is the story behind it that appeals to me the most. This magnificent beauty stands strong as a symbol of the love of a husband to his wife. Moreover, it reminds us of the power of love and how it can set an example for generations to come.

            Taj Maha – A Symbol of Love
            The renowned Taj Mahal was brought to life by the vision of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. He got this monument built for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal after she passed away.
            
            To honor the memory of his loving wife, Shah Jahan ordered the finest artisans from all over the world to build it. He wanted to make something that had never been done before for anyone. The emperor wished to give the last gift to his wife whom he loved very much.
            
            Even till date, people sing praises about Shah Jahan’s grand gesture. It makes you believe in love and appreciate it like never before. We also see how under the tomb lies the body of the eternal lovers. Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal are buried next to each other and even after death, they remained side by side.

            Making of Taj Mahal
            Taj Mahal was declared as a Heritage Site by UNSECO in 1983. What makes this monument so special? Why do people come from all walks of life to witness its magnificence? Taj Mahal is made from white marble. Subsequently, this marble was exported from various countries from all over the world.
            
            They began constructing it in 1630 and it finally got completed in a time span of almost 20 years. Shah Jahan rejected numerous designs before finally settling on the present structure of the Taj Mahal. The walls of the monument are engraved with quite expensive stones.</h2>

          <p></p><h2>The Charminar constructed in 1591, is a monument and mosque located in
     Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The landmark has become known globally as
     a symbol of Hyderabad and is listed among the most recognised structures
     in India. The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu
     words chār and minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"Built in the year 1591 AD, Charminar is the beating heart of Hyderabadis. The landmark of the city was built by the fifth ruler of Qutb Shahi dynasty, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. Charminar, a monument and mosque, is an imposing model that celebrates the influence of the Muslim Turkomans in India. Considered to be in the top ten monuments of the country, here’s a little something about the structure and its history.
     Charminar is a square-shaped structure built out of granite and lime mortar. The monument predominantly has an Islamic-style design, but influences of Hindu architecture can also be seen in its ornamentation. It is flanked by four minarets on every corner which are 48.7 meters high. It is believed that the four minarets are symbolic of Islam’s first four Khalifas. Each minaret is four stories tall, and the floors are divided by beautifully carved rings around it. The mosque is located on the top floor, and visitors can enjoy a short climb of the 149 steps to get there.
     The reason behind building such an architectural marvel remains unclear, though it is widely accepted that the Charminar was built to commemorate the eradication of the plague which was widespread during that period in the city. According to Jean de Thévenot, a French traveler of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persian texts, the construction was done to celebrate the beginning of the second Islamic millennium year. Others have come to believe that the king erected the structure at the very spot where he first laid his eyes on his future begum (wife), Bhagmati.
     
     Charminar is at its best when it lights up at night in the lively neighborhood of colorful bazaar and shops.

          <p></p><h2>The India Gate is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath
    , on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi,
     formerly called Kingsway.Designed by Sir Edwin
     Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the
     triumphal arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome
    , and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and 
    the Gateway of India in Mumbai.At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I. The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919.

    The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was designed by Edwin Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence. The eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.

       Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam 
       Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by 
       a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith
        of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based
         on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion 
         of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative planning and architectural style, including the garden
          design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.</h2>

It is a three-storied stone structure, with marble domes and a 145 ft five-storied tower. Above the central arch is an impressive sculpture of Gajalakshmi, the goddess of wealth, prosperity, good luck, and abundance with her elephants. The palace is surrounded by a large garden.

It's a kaleidoscope of stained glass &amp; mirrors. The tastefully decorated and intricately carved doors open into luxuriously decorated rooms. The ground floor with an enclosed courtyard displays costumes, musical instruments, children's toys, and numerous portraits. The upper floor has a small collection of weapons. The beautifully carved mahogany ceilings, solid silver doors, white marble floors, and superb columned Durbar Hall are a feast to the eyes. </h2><p></p>
